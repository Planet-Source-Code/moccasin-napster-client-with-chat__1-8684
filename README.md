## Napster Client with Chat


</div>

### Description

This is a Napster client with chat example! It's like my last Napster client example except I've fixed a TON of bugs/problems, made it a little bit more efficient, made the code a little neater, and of course.. you can now chat with this! I've also included more information on how to communicate with Napster's servers using VB incase you would like to add additional functionality to it. Vote if you like this example!
